// Operators come into play when you want to work with variables, modify them, perform calculations and compare them.

// Arithmetic Operators

let tb1 = 20;
let tb2 = 4;

let result1 = tb1 + tb2;
console.log(result1); // Output: 24

// String Concatenation

let str1 = "What up ";
let str2 = "addition";

let result2 = str1 + str2;
console.log(result2); // Output: What up addition

// Practice with Operators

let name = "Tim";
let age = 44;

let result3 = "My name is " + name + ", I am " + age + " years old and learning to code JavaScript";
console.log(result3); // Output: My name is Tim, I am 44 years old and learning to code JavaScript

// Subtraction Operators

let tb3 = 44;
let tb4 = 23;

let result4 = tb3 - tb4;
console.log(result4); // Output: 21
