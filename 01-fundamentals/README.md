## Variables & Data Types

### Variables

**Variables** are values in your code that can represent different values each time the code runs.

**Declaring Variables:** The first time you create a variable, you must declare it. The second time you create a variable, you only use the name of the variable to assign it to a new value.

**let, var, and const:** The let, var, and const keywords are used to declare variables. let and var are related to the scope of the variable. var has global scope and let has block scope.


> [!NOTE]
>  
> **global scope:** The global scope means that you can access the variables defined with var in the entire script.
> 
> **block scope:** The block scope means that you can only use variables defined with let in the specific block of code in which it is defined.
> 
> **const:** is used to declare a constant that only get a value assigned once.  (ex. line 25 in variables.js).

## Operators

**Operators:** come into play when you want to work with variables, modify them, perform calculations and compare them.

### Arithmetic Operators

This type of operator is used to perform mathematical operations with numbers. These operations include basic mathematics that you are familiar with, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
